## Session Log

<!-- Example entry (auto-generated):
## Session 2025-01-15
- Approved: 3 posts — topics: AI tooling, developer productivity, open source
- Rejected: 2 posts — reasons: too generic, sounded like LinkedIn advice
- Feedback: "shorter, punchier — I don't write essays on Twitter"
- Edit delta: shortened from 280 chars to 140, removed the rhetorical question opener
- Pattern: prefers observations over advice. Rejects anything that sounds prescriptive.
