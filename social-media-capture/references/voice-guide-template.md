## Core Writing Style

### Tone

- [E.g., "Observational, not prescriptive — describes what IS, not what SHOULD be"]
- [E.g., "Contrarian — challenges popular narratives"]

### Sentence Length
- [E.g., "Short. Punchy. Often fragments."]
- [E.g., "Mix of short declarations and one longer explanatory sentence"]

### Word Choice
- [E.g., "Technical but accessible — uses industry terms without explaining them"]
- [E.g., "No corporate speak, no filler words, no 'Great question!'"]

### Punctuation & Formatting
- [E.g., "Em dashes for asides. No exclamation marks. Minimal emojis."]
- [E.g., "Line breaks between ideas, not walls of text"]
