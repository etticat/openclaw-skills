# Audio Coaching Topic Log

Track daily audio sessions to avoid repetition and ensure coverage.

**READ THIS ENTIRE LOG before generating a new session.** Check not just categories but the specific themes, advice, frameworks, and stories used. Don't repeat yourself.

## Categories

Define categories that map to your coaching pillars + recurring themes:

1. **COMM** — Communication skills, speaking up, difficult conversations
2. **WORK** — Career, leadership, team dynamics
3. **REL** — Relationship skills, connection, presence
4. **WELL** — Wellbeing, stress management, exercise, sleep
5. **BOOK** — Book concept applied to your life (one per day)
6. **INDUSTRY** — Your industry news, competitors, trends
7. **REVIEW** — Weekly planning and review
8. **LIFE** — Life design, identity, purpose

Customize these to match your pillars.

## Log

Record each session to prevent repetition:

| Date | Category | Topic & Key Points | Type |
|------|----------|-------------------|------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | BOOK | [Book title] Ch X: [concept]. Applied to [situation]. [Key insight]. | Morning |
| YYYY-MM-DD | WORK | [Topic] — [what was covered, frameworks used, stories told] | Morning |
| YYYY-MM-DD | REL | [Topic] — [specific advice given, pre-commits] | Evening |

## Rules

1. **Never repeat a framework** within 7 days
2. **Never tell the same story** twice in 14 days
3. **Rotate categories** — don't do 3 WORK sessions in a row
4. **Book concepts:** one per day, applied to a specific situation. Not a summary.
5. **Check the log FIRST** — if you covered "separation of tasks" on Monday, don't cover it again until next week
6. **Log every session** — even on-demand evening sessions
