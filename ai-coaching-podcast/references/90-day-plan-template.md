# 90-Day Coaching Plan: [START DATE] – [END DATE]

> Practical, week-by-week plan to close the insight-action gap. Not aspirational. Doable.

---

## How This Plan Works

**Daily rhythm:**
- ☀️ **Morning pre-commit** (via coaching podcast): "If X happens today, I will say Y"
- 🎧 **Commute audio** (30 min): Topic of the week — deep-dive, not passive listening
- 🌙 **Evening reflection** (via scorecard): Prompted reflection, pattern tracking

**Weekly rhythm:**
- Monday: Set week's targets (from plan below)
- Friday: Quick scorecard
- Sunday: 10-min review — what worked, what didn't

**Adaptation rules:**
- Feeling overwhelmed → cut to 1 target per category, not zero
- Something not working after 2 weeks → change the approach, not the goal
- Something working → increase frequency or depth
- Crisis week → maintenance mode: just do the daily rhythm, skip weekly targets

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–4)

**Focus:** Build the daily rhythm. Practice basics. Establish baselines.

### Week 1
| Pillar | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| [Pillar 1] | [One specific, tiny action] | [Observable evidence] |
| [Pillar 2] | [One specific, tiny action] | [Observable evidence] |
| [Pillar 3] | [One specific, tiny action] | [Observable evidence] |

### Week 2
| Pillar | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| [Pillar 1] | [Slight increase from Week 1] | [...] |
| [Pillar 2] | [...] | [...] |
| [Pillar 3] | [...] | [...] |

### Weeks 3–4
[Same pattern, gradually increasing targets]

---

## Phase 2: Practice (Weeks 5–8)

**Focus:** Move from conscious effort to natural habit. Introduce harder scenarios.

[Fill in weekly targets that build on Phase 1]

---

## Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 9–12)

**Focus:** These behaviors should feel normal. Push into uncomfortable territory.

[Fill in weekly targets that push boundaries]

## Tips

- **Start embarrassingly small.** Week 1 targets should feel too easy. That's correct.
- **Track evidence, not feelings.** "I spoke up once in standup" > "I felt more confident."
- **The plan adapts to you.** The AI coaching system reads this plan and adjusts the daily podcast to match your current phase and targets.
- **Don't skip the scorecard.** It's the data that feeds the coaching system. No data = generic advice.
